# RandomForest
Implementation of Random Forest ensemble classifier algorithm to predict the class of iris plant using Python

Description:- Random forests is an ensemble learning algorithm. The basic premise of the algorithm is that building a small decision-tree with few features is a computationally cheap process. If we can build many small, weak decision trees in parallel, we can then combine the trees to form a single, strong learner by averaging or taking the majority vote.
